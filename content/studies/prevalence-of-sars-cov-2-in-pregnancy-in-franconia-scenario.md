For this prospective observational study, 2.400 pregnant women of all weeks of pregnancy are recruited at nine study centres in the German region of Franconia. At baseline, general and pregnancy-associated diseases, history and prevalent COVID-19-typical symptoms and previous testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection are recorded. Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA as well as a blood sample for the evaluation of IgG antibody status by anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. The primary outcome parameter is the rate of seropositive pregnancies in each of the three consecutive time cohorts. Secondary outcome parameters include prenatal, peripartum and postpartum maternal and neonatal morbidity.
